## Introduction

**source{d} Community Edition (CE)** helps you to manage all your code and engineering data in one place powerful:

- **Code Retrieval**: Retrieve and store the git history of the code of your organization as a dataset.
- **Analysis in/for any Language**: Automatically identify languages, parse source code, and extract the pieces that matter in a distributed and language-agnostic way.
- **History Analysis**: Extract information from the evolution, commits, and metadata of your codebase and from Github, generating detailed reports and insights.
- **Familiar APIs**: Analyze your code through powerful SQL queries. Use tools you're familiar with to create reports and dashboards.

This repository contains the code of **source{d} Community Edition (CE)** and its project documentation, which you can also see properly rendered at [docs.sourced.tech/community-edition](https://docs.sourced.tech/community-edition).
